## Description

In order to stay competitive in online retail, a solid backend database management system is needed. This app uses Node, Express, MySQL, and Sequelize ORM to help a business keep track of its products. This relational database allows us to crossreference products, categories, and tags.

## Installation

Install the following as npm dependencies: express, dotenv, myql2, sequelize. Notice that mysql2 is needed in order to work with sequelize. Use a seed script in your package.json in order to run the seed.js so that the models and seeds are used to populate our db with data. You will need to make sure to take the SQL language from the schema and run it in Workbench or another MySQL editor.

## Usage

Use insomnia or similar app to test all the routes created. GET routes will return all or one. POST routes will create new entries. PUT routes will update entries. DELETE routes will remove entries. Watch the linked video to see a walkthrough.
